# PdfViewer
A lightweight Pdf Viewer App for Android

I used the [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer) SDK to implement it. 
The app targets Android SDK 29 (Android 10) and when a PDF file is clicked on on another app (such as Whatsapp), you are redirected to the app and are able to 
view the PDF. 

You can access the APK by following [this](https://github.com/melihozcan1/PdfViewer/blob/main/PdfViewer.apk) link.
