# PdfViewer
A lightweight Pdf Viewer App for Android

I used the [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer) SDK to implement it. 
The app targets Android SDK 29 (Android 10) and when a PDF file is clicked on on another app (such as Whatsapp), you are redirected to the app and are able to 
view the PDF.
